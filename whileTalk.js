// While Talk

/* Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ 
and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’. 

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:
    1. There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
    2. The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.*/
